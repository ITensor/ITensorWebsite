# Contracting ITensors

Tensor contraction is often the most costly
step of tensor algorithms.
Code for contracting tensors can be 
fragile and error-prone when the tensor interface depends
on the index ordering.

ITensor gets around these issues by using "intelligent"
indices which recognize each other and automatically contract,
regardless of the order they are in. ITensor works behind
the scenes to make sure this is done as efficiently as possible.

To contract two ITensors, use
the `*` operator, which <i>contracts all matching indices</i>.
Some pairs of indices may match, yet you do not want them to be
contracted. To prevent this from happening, change the prime
level of such indices on one or both tensors as in the 
second example below.

### A Simple Example

Given three distinct Index objects i,j, and k, say 
we make the following ITensors:

    auto A = ITensor(i,j);
    auto B = ITensor(k,j);

Then the following code contracts over the index j

    auto C = A * B;

In traditional notation this means performing the sum
$$
C\_{i k} = \sum\_j A\_{i j} B\_{k j} \ .
$$
If there had been other matching indices
between A and B other than j, the `*` operator would have contracted 
them too. Indices i and k did not match (they could be copies of the 
same Index but we are assuming this is not the case) so they remain 
uncontracted and become the indices of C. 

Interestingly, because of the way ITensor contraction is defined,
`B*A` gives the same result as `A*B`.
ITensor contraction is a commutative operation.

### A More Complex Example

Of course, the real usefulness of a tensor library is handling
cases where tensors have three or more indices.

Say we have an ITensor with indices i,s, and j
     
    auto W = ITensor(i,s,j);

and want to contract W with itself, summing over indices i and j,
but leaving s uncontracted.

In traditional tensor notation, we want to compute
$$
D\_{s s^\prime} = \sum\_{i,j} W\_{i s j} W\_{i s^\prime j} \ .
$$
But this notation can become cumbersome for more complicated contractions.

A nicer way to notate a tensor contraction is 
by using a diagram

<img class="diagram" width="40%" src="docs/VERSION/book/images/WW_contraction.png"/>

In diagram notation a tensor is a blob and each line denotes an index. 
Connecting two lines implies those indices are summed over.
The remaining unpaired lines are the indices of the resulting tensor.

Both notations indicate our contraction strategy should be to 
prime the Index s on one copy of W. Calling `prime(W,s)` returns
a copy of W with s replaced by s'. Then multiplying

    auto D = W * prime(W,s);

automatically contracts i and j, but not s and s' since these
no longer compare equal. Printing the result D confirms that it
has only s and s' as indices.
